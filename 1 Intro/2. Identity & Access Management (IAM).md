## IAM: Users & Group

- IAM is a Global service.
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared.
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users, not other groups.
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.

**Policies**: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups.
## IAM: Roles for Services

- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf.
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.
- Common roles:
	- EC2 Instance Roles
	- Lambda Function Roles
	- Roles for CloudFormation

## IAM: Guidelines & Best Practices

- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup.
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups.
- Create a strong password policy.
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services.
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK).
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor.
- **Never share IAM users & Access Keys**.
