- Regional Service
- Supports Multi AZ
- Spread load across multiple EC2 instances
- Separate public traffic from private traffic
- Health checks allow ELB to know which instances are working properly
- **Does not support weighted routing**

### Health Checks

- Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
- The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

## Types of ELB

#### Classic Load Balancer (CLB) - deprecated

- **Load Balancing to a single application**
- Supports HTTP, HTTPS (layer 7) & TCP (layer 4)
- Health checks are HTTP or TCP based
- Provides a fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Load balancing to multiple applications** (target groups) based on the request parameters
- Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket)
- Provides a fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
- ALB terminates the upstream connection and creates a new downstream connection to the targets (TCP termination)
- **Security Groups can be attached to ALBs** to filters requests
- Great for micro services & container-based applications (Docker & ECS)
- Client info is passed in the request headers
    - Client IP => `X-Forwarded-For`
    - Client Port => `X-Forwarded-Port`
    - Protocol => `X-Forwarded-Proto`
- Target Groups
    - Health checks are done at the target group level
    - Target Groups could be
        - EC2 instances - HTTP
        - ECS tasks - HTTP
        - Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
        - Private IP Addresses
- **Listener Rules** can be configured to route traffic to different target groups based on:
    - Path (domain.com/users & domain.com/posts)
    - Hostname (one.example.com & other.example.com)
    - Query String (domain.com/users?id=123&order=false)
    - Request Headers
    - Source IP address

#### Network Load Balancer (NLB)[

- Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
- Can handle millions of request per seconds (extreme performance)
- **Lower latency** ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
- **1 static public IP per AZ** (vs a static hostname for CLB & ALB)
- **Elastic IP can be assigned to NLB** (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
- Maintains the same connection (TCP or UDP) from client all the way to the target application
- **No security groups can be attached to NLBs.** Since they operate on layer 4, they cannot see the data available at layer 7. They just forward the incoming traffic to the right target group as if those requests were directly coming from client. So, the **attached instances must allow TCP traffic on port 80 from anywhere**.
- Within a target group, NLB can send traffic to
    - **EC2 instances**
        - If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the **primary private IP address**
    - **IP addresses**
        - Used when you want to balance load for a physical server having a static IP.
    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
        - Used when you want a static IP provided by an NLB but also want to use the features provided by ALB at the application layer.

#### Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)[

- Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol
- Used to route requests to a fleet of 3rd party virtual appliances like Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), etc.
- Performs two functions:
    - **Transparent Network Gateway** (single entry/exit for all traffic)
    - Load Balancer (distributes traffic to virtual appliances)
- Uses **GENEVE** protocol
- Target groups for GWLB could be
    - EC2 instances
    - IP addresses

## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

- Requests coming from a client is always redirected to the same instance based on a cookie. After the cookie expires, the requests coming from the same user might be redirected to another instance.
- **Only supported by CLB & ALB** because the cookie can be seen at layer 7
- Used to ensure the user doesn’t lose his session data, like login or cart info, while navigating between web pages.
- **Stickiness may cause load imbalance**
- Cookies could be
    - **Application-based** (TTL defined by the application)
    - **Load Balancer generated** (TTL defined by the load balancer)
- ELB reserved cookie names (should not be used)
    - AWSALB
    - AWSALBAPP
    - AWSALBTG

## Cross-zone Load Balancing[

- Allows ELBs in different AZ containing unbalanced number of instances to distribute the traffic evenly across all instances in all the AZ registered under a load balancer.
- ![[cross-zone-LB.png]]
- Supported Load Balancers
    - Classic Load Balancer
        - Disabled by default
        - No charges for inter AZ data
    - Application Load Balancer
        - Always on (can’t be disabled)
        - No charges for inter AZ data
    - Network Load Balancer
        - Disabled by default
        - Charges for inter AZ data

## SSL/TLS

- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
- **Load Balancer - SSL Certificates**
	- The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
	- You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
	- You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
	- HTTPS listener:
		- You must specify a default certificate
		- You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
		- Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
		- Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL / TLS (legacy clients)
> **SNI(Server Name Identification)** solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
	- It’s a “newer” protocol, and requires the client to indicate the hostname of target server in the initial SSL handshake
	- Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generation), CloudFront

## Connection Draining (De-registration Delay)

- When an instance is to be de-registered from the ELB, the in-flight requests being served by that instance are given some pre-defined time to complete before the ELB de-registers it.
- ELB stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
- Set manually (0 to 3600 seconds) (**default: 300 seconds**)

## Access Logs

- Captures detailed information about requests sent to the load balancer
- Used to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues
- Disabled by default
