# Elastic File System

- Managed Network File System (NFS)
- Can be mounted on multiple EC2 instancesÂ in multi-AZs
- Highly available & scalable
- More expensive than gp2
- Pay per use
- Security group must be used to control access
- Compatible with Linux based AMIs (not Windows)
- NFSv4.1 protocol
- _uses case_: content management, web serving, data sharing

## Performance Mode

- **General Purpose (default)**
	- Provides a balance between price and performance for most workloads.
	- Suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Max I/O**
	- Offers higher throughput and IOPS for applications that require high levels of performance. 
	- Ideal for large-scale, data-intensive applications.

## Throughput Mode

- **Bursting** 
	- Allows you to burst to a higher performance level for short periods of time.
	- Cost-effective for workloads with variable performance needs.
- **Provisioned** 
	- Provides a fixed level of performance. 
	- Suitable for applications with consistent performance requirements.
- **Elastic** 
	- Automatically scales performance based on workload demands.
	- Providing a balance between cost and performance for dynamic workloads.

## Storage Tiers

- **Standard**
    - Multi-AZ
    - For frequently accessed files
    - High durability and availability with multi-AZ replication. Ideal for production environments where data access is frequent and performance is critical.
- **Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)**
    - Single-AZ
    - For less frequently accessed files
    - Lower cost for storage compared to the Standard tier but incurs retrieval costs. Suitable for data that is accessed occasionally but needs to be available quickly when needed.
